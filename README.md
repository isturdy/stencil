Stencil
=======

A simple string template library with runtime template loading.

Note that runtime loading of templates prevents static checks of template (for invalid references, or invocation of a value of the wrong type. In such cases the library will produce the best output it can and a list of errors.


Template syntax
===============

Reserved characters and escaping
--------------------------------

In all contexts, Stencil reserves doubled and tripled angle brackets ('<<') and pipes ('|'). If at least two consecutive angle brackets are needed within the text, add two; '<<<<' becomes '<<', '<<<<<' '<<<', and so on. Pipes also are escaped by adding two additional pipes.

For disambiguation, variable names may not begin with '?', '%', '@', '!', '$', '&', fewer than three pipes, or fewer than four closing angle brackets.

Substitutions
-------------

    <<name>>

Substitute the value of *name* (which should be text or a Haskell value with a defined conversion to text) from the present context. In all substitutions, tripling the surrounding brackets (`<<<name>>>}`) results in the contained text being HTML escaped.

    <<?name| text1 | text2 >>

If *name* is in the dictionary, substitute *text1*; otherwise substitute *text2*.

    <<%name| text >>

Evaluate *text* in the context of the dictionary referred to by *name*. Within *text*, any lookups not found in that dictionary are passed to the next higher context.

    <<@name| text | alternate text >>

Substitute *text* for each item of the list referred to by *name*. If *name* is a list of texts, they can be accessed with '<<>>' within *text*, so that `<ul><<@listname |<li><<>></li>></ul>` becomes `<ul><li>item1</li><li>item2</li></ul>`. If the list is empty, substitute the alternate text if present. if *name* refers to a list of dictionaries, each evaluation of *text* is in the context of the corresponding dictionary.

    <<!functionname| valuename >>

Substitute the result of applying the function to the value. Note that arbitrary Haskell is not allowed; the function used must be explicitly placed in the dictionary.

    <<$functionname| text >>

Substitute the result of applying the function to the text, after making substitutions within the text.

    <<&templatename>>

Substitute and evaluate the named template.
